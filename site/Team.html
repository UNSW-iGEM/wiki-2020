        <h2>Annabelle Lee (HP Lead)</h2>
        <p>Annabelle is a third year Advanced Science and Law student. She joined iGEM because she was interested in understanding and exploring the societal implications of synthetic biology solutions on conservation problems. She is the HP team leader and has also been involved with writing grants. In her free time, Annabelle helps curate the iGEM party mixtape, and she, funnily enough, likes to think about and tries to relive her Year 6 disco.</p>
