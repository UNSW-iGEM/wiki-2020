		<h1>LAB WORK</h1>

		<div class="att-des">
			<h2>A/Prof. David Suggett</h2>
			<p>Professor Suggett gave us helpful lab advice, directing us away from the use of coral probiotics due to its complexity as a growing area of research. He also suggested using combination techniques such as electroporation with protoplasts for transforming Symbiodinium. Moreover, David proposed choosing Symbiodinium from Clade C and D as they were more common in the GBR, as opposed to Symbiodinium microadriaticum, which are rare and may disturb the natural ecosystem.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="att-des">
			<h2>Professor Madeline Van Oppen</h2>
			<p>Professor Van Oppen advised our wet lab team about developing stable transformants for Symbiodiniaciae. Professor Van Oppen also provided us with contacts to colleagues working on CRISPR-Cas9 modification of Symbiodinium.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="att-des">
			<h2>Associate Professor Wallace Bridge</h2>
			<p>Professor Wallace Bridge helped design our antioxidant protection system for Symbiodinium, and advised us to upregulate glutathione reductase to increase the antioxidant capacity of our system. He also confirmed that bifunctional glutathione synthetase is a good choice over the two enzymes glutamate cysteine ligase and glutathione synthase due to its simplicity and lack of product inhibition.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="att-des">
			<h2>Melissa Katon</h2>
			<p>Melissa Katon has helped us shape our future lab work by expressing concerns about the complexity of coral probiotics. In addition to this, she has helped us in the design of our proposed implementation, giving us suggestions on the possible ex-situ farming of our modified Symbiodinium model through the Sydney Institute of Marine Science (SIMS).</p>
		</div>

		<div class="att-des">
			<h2>Jesse Bergman </h2>
			<p>Jesse helped us understand the benefits of using invertebrates in lab work, as well as gave us advice about importing coral to commercial aquaria facilities.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="att-des">
			<h2>Brian Ee, Molecular Dynamics Advisor</h2>
			<p>Brian, using his molecular dynamics and past iGEMer expertise, was extremely informative regarding our protein structure modelling work. He provided us with sample scripts and innumerable explanations to help us understand the rationale and assumptions behind the software we used. Interpretation and then the utilisation of molecular dynamics outputs can also be a true adventure, and in this respect, Brian was a brilliant guide. Lastly, we are most grateful to Brian for the extensive troubleshooting and alternate analysis methods he showed us, without which our models would not be what they have become.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="att-des">
			<h2>Dr Rodrigo Santibáñez, Dry lab simulation </h2>
			<p>We would like to thank Dr. Santibáñez for helping our dry lab team debug our models with the PySB package through the PySB gitter platform. We are thankful for his time for introducing us to new methods and packages such as Kappa.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="att-des">
			<h2>Professor Mark Tanaka, Mathematical Modelling</h2>
			<p>We would like to thank Professor Tanaka for giving our dry lab team a general overview and set of best practices for mathematical modelling.

Additionally, Professor Tanaka helped clarify the background on the stochastic Gillepsie algorithm used by BioNetGen.</p>

		<h1>HUMAN PRACTICES</h1>

		<div class="att-des">
			<h2>Professor Matthew Kearnes </h2>
			<p>Professor Kearnes has helped us with our Human Practices framework by advising us to view our solution in either a ‘mitigation or adaptation’ perspective. He helped us identify the aim of our solution as one that adapts corals due to the changing climate. In addition, he helped us expand our understanding of the existing mutualistic relationship between science and people. </p>
		</div>

		<div class="att-des">
			<h2>Associate Professor David Suggett</h2>
			<p>We would like to thank Professor Suggett for introducing the concept of social licensing to us and helping us with the structure of our Human Practices framework. Professor Suggett allowed us to understand the importance of the suggestions of our stakeholders on our solution more deeply, and explained that these suggestions are just as important as any official license or permit. </p>
		</div>

		<div class="att-des">
			<h2>Dr. Aditi Mankad </h2>
			<p>We would like to thank Dr. Mankad for kindly sharing the results of the National survey, which allowed us to gather an understanding on Australian public attitudes regarding the synthetic biological solutions on conservation and environmental problems. </p>

		</div>

		<div class="att-des">
			<h2>Associate Professor Suhelen Egan </h2>
			<p>Professor Egan highlighted the delicate and complex microbial interactions found on the coral holobiont. She helped us understand the necessity of these interactions in bioprospecting practices, and explained that any potential solution must seek to protect them.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="att-des">
			<h2>Australian Coastal Local Council</h2>
			<p>The council provided insight on the Statewide effort to adapt the coast for the coastal hazards of the future. Their explanation on how councils survey the community, and what they prioritise in community solutions, was incredibly helpful in understanding how local government acts to help their communities. We are grateful for their aid in navigating coastal community and council values, so that we could better understand how we can make a good and responsible solution for the world.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="att-des">
			<h2>Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) </h2>
			<p>The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) manages the Great Barrier Reef region under the guidance of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975. In partnership with Australian and Queensland government agencies, and various stakeholders including tourism and fishing industries, the GBRMPA stewards the reef by using the ‘best available science’ to protect the environment and dependent communities.</p>
