        <td>Integrated Human Practices</td>
        <td>Through our silver HP work, the consultation of our main stakeholder groups and experts in the field of social science has led us to manipulate our project based on the values of these stakeholders. In our integrated human practices work, we demonstrate the way in which we empathise with the needs and wants of the people who are concerned about the reef’s health. Additional academics who looked through the workflow of our wet lab and dry lab methodology allowed us to achieve our present goals as well as advised us on our future goals. By consulting with a number of academics and stakeholders through our silver HP work, we were able to identify the ‘issues’ in the direction of our project and adapt accordingly. Therefore, by doing this our team was able to focus on the values that stakeholders deemed the most important.

        <td>Project Modelling</td>
        <td>To gain insight into how our proposed engineered heat shock and ROS response system in Symbiodinium would work, the dry lab team created both structural and mathematical models to supplement the wet lab assays. In the <a href="https://2020.igem.org/Team:UNSW_Australia/Model/structural">structural modelling</a>, the components of our system investigated were the monomers, dimers and the 12mer complex that the recombinant HSP22 complex was known to exist as. Fold recognition, docking and molecular dynamic simulations were run. In <a href="https://2020.igem.org/Team:UNSW_Australia/Model/mathematical">mathematical modelling</a>, models of the new engineered system were compared to the wild type to predict the transcriptomic/metabolomic changes on level of the cell. Both stochastic and deterministic models were implemented using the PySB library.</td>

        <td>Best Education</td>
        <td>Our team has created various educational components targeting a wide range of audiences, including children, adolescents and the general public. We aimed to educate individuals who may be affiliated with each target audience simultaneously. For example, while the children’s activity book and the educational package were intended for children and high school students, it may also impact others involved, such as educators and parents/guardians. Furthermore, while physical activities were minimised due to the pandemic, our team created a virtual escape room game as an innovative way to reach and expose university students to synthetic biology, and to allow for open discussion in a fun way. We have planned future collaborations to distribute these materials to more individuals in order to continue inspiring them about the application of the science of synthetic biology in the real world through the lens of our project. </td>

      <tr>
        <td>Best Integrated HP</td>
        <td>Integrated HP, to the UNSW iGEM 2020 team, is understanding the mutualistic relationship between people and science. Our human-centred design began by consulting ethicists and social-scientists on how we frame the problem and ask questions, given the complex dynamic between society and synthetic-biology. From there, our research and development was driven by the environmental, social, economic, cultural values, which stemmed from the stakeholders we spoke with, including Traditional Owners, coastal management, bioprospecting, and tourism. These conversations were meaningful, sustained, and important in every part of our HP journey. We not only listened to how these stakeholders were impacted, but we empathised with them. With these understandings, we reached out to coral experts and academics who informed the technical aspects of our solution. Together, our conversations resulted in a rich framework that accounted for nuanced values, to create a good and responsible solution to coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef. </td>

      <tr>
        <td>Best Model</td>
        <td>The central question our models sought to answer was ‘How would the HSP22E/F system function in our engineered Symbiodinium?’. In the absence of any substantive literature present on algae systems let alone Symbiodinium, the dry lab team created novel models to better understand our engineered Symbiodinium. Protein structure modelling gave us an atomic view to build an understanding of the function of the heat shock proteins. Extended molecular dynamics simulations and custom de novo loop modelling was conducted to get as robust models as we possibly could. Mathematical modelling was also conducted to get a macroscopic view of how the altered expression system of heat shock proteins and glutathione would change the heat shock response of our engineered symbiodinium. The model created is highly tunable and both stochastic and deterministic models were created to see which type performed better.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Best Basic New Part</td>
        <td>Considering the impact of rising water temperatures on coral bleaching, introducing engineered symbiodinium into the coral tissue is a promising solution. Through extensive research and laboratory experimentation, our team was successful in demonstrating the effect of small heat shock proteins 22E and 22F in reducing protein aggregation, when compared to citrate synthase. Being aware of the high transcription rate of small heat shock proteins as holdases, these molecular chaperones are capable of reversing coral bleaching by preventing vulnerable proteins from becoming insoluble and hence, dysfunctional. Since coral reefs are a source of food for millions of sea organisms, our engineered part has the potential to protect this important ecosystem. </td>

        <td>Best Sustainable Development Impact</td>
        <td>Our solution to coral bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef meets three Sustainable Development Goals: <br>1. #13 Climate Action - The effect of climate change on rising ocean temperatures directly affects the marine environment inhabited by corals. By using a synthetic biology centered solution, we believe it’s possible to help corals adapt to a rapidly-changing climate. <br>2. #14 Life Below Water - Our project is centred around protecting marine ecosystems. By protecting coral, the Great Barrier Reef’s ecosystem will continue to thrive, contributing to the protection of unique species and the reef’s biodiverse nature.<br> 3. #17 Partnerships - We have spent the year collaborating with teams whose projects are also focused on reef restoration and preservation. By partnering with these teams, we were able to work together, which in turn, strengthened our solutions and allowed us to more effectively contribute to a global effort to save coral reefs. </td>
