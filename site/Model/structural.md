summary: The central dogma of proteins is that with the understanding of the structure of a protein, comes the understanding of its function. We utilised fold recognition template modelling with the i-TASSER server to impose a reasonable 3D structure onto a sequence of peptides. After the refinement of these monomer models with molecular dynamics simulations, dimers and a larger 12mer complex was constructed to lead to an atomic understanding of how heat shock proteins function.

## How
Refer to 2019 team’s guide on how to create 3D structure files of proteins, we will extend this tutorial by showing you how to dock protein units together to form a complex. % of proteins that are actually part of a multi-unit complex?

## What
Need to be written

We don’t know what the range of complex sizes it can be
