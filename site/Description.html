      <h2>It is one of Earth's Natural Wonders...</h2>
      
      <p>The Great Barrier Reef is home to 75% of the world’s coral species, and thousands more marine animals and organisms. Its coral reef, the largest in the world, contains over 600 coral species, accounting for three-quarters of the world’s population. The GBR provides 64,000 jobs, and contributes $6.4 billion annually to the Australian economy (“Reef facts,” n.d.). </p>

    <div class="inspiration">
      <p id="first">In Janurary 2020, the Australian skies were painted red with flames from the Black Summer bushfires. In Februray 2020, Australia experienced the warmest ocean temperature on record, bleaching 60% of the Great Barrier Reef.</p>

      <p>The Australian environment has been ravaged by climate change. The effect of climate change on our Great Barrier Reef, and coral reefs around the world, has been devastating. We are inspired by the immense strength the Australian people have shown in the face of lost loved-ones, homes and livelihoods.</p>

      <p>The Great Barrier Reef is much more than a stretch of vivid technicolour beneath our waters. It represents age-old history, the culture of our Traditional Owners, and the rich vitality of Australia’s natural environment. Therefore, this conservation project is directed by the conversations we are opening up with stakeholders, whose voices are vital in shaping our solution. </p>

      <h1>The Coral Bleaching Problem</h1>
      <p>Reef building coral are composed of ‘polyps’ which secrete white calcium carbonate skeletons (CaCO3). In Australia, these coral polyps contain symbiotic microalgae, including the family Symbiodiniaceae, which generate nutrients necessary for survival (Roth M.S, 2014)1. External stressors, such as the increase of ocean temperatures, are destructive to coral: the coral undergoes protein denaturation and algal cells accumulate reactive oxygen species (ROS). As a result, the coral rejects the algal symbionts, resulting in coral starvation and death. As the microalgae leaves the coral polyp, the remaining white skeleton is visible as the bleached-white expanse that already blankets more than 60% of the Great Barrier Reef.</p>

      <h1>Why use a synthetic biological solution?</h1>
      <p>Climate change is a divisive issue that cannot be resolved overnight. It requires a major and effective international social and political effort, and a complete upheaval to the attitudes of millions of people and industries worldwide. Promises have been made, but beneficial effects are yet to be seen, and may likely never come to fruition. Even if we were to solve climate change tomorrow, the far-reaching impacts of the damage already done will continue to cause devastating effects on the world’s natural environment, including our coral reefs. </p>

      <p>Our project adopts an ‘adaptation’ approach in order to use synthetic biology to help corals adapt to the effects of rising ocean temperatures and an unpredictable climate. Advancements in genetic technology expand possibilities of conservation of the natural environment, including genetic rescue. The UNSW iGEM team is inspired by the innovation and creativity of those using synthetic biology to solve conservation issues. </p>

      <p id="last">The current efforts to combat coral bleaching involve replanting corals, coral nurseries and directed evolution. Synthetic biology offers a considerably faster mechanism to coral conservation, but is intended as the ‘last line of defence’ in our fight to save coral reefs.</p>

    <div class="HP-goals">
      <h1>HP Goals</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>To design a safe, responsible and meaningful project to combat coral bleaching. This is to be achieved through a focus on the creativity and innovation of the science itself, but also a detailed exploration on the societal aspects of our problem </li>
        <li>To incorporate the human voice and voice of various stakeholders in our solution, making sure our design is as human-centred as possible </li>
        <li>To generate conversation around synthetic biology on conservation issues</li>
        <li>To contribute to a global effort towards combating coral bleaching </li>
        <li>To raise awareness of the effect of climate change on pristine natural environments</li>

      <ol>
        <li>sHSPs</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Express sHSP22E/F separately in  E.coli (BL21) and purify the proteins </li>
            <li>Assess the chaperone activity of sHSP22E/F by comparing the aggregation of heat sensitive enzyme, citrate synthase with sHSP22E/F and without. </li>
            <li>Show sHSP22E/F interact with each other to form large complex 12-mer structures that can hold and prevent protein aggregation through a Native gel </li>
            <li>Show the chaperone activity of sHSP22E/F is more effective when they are mixed together as opposed to them being separated </li>
          </ul>

        <li>Glutathione</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Design a glutathione antioxidant system that could be introduced into Symbiodinium in the future that is not impacted by product inhibition. </li>
            <li>The bifunctional glutathione synthetase is able to catalyse both steps in the production of glutathione and is not impacted by glutathione product inhibition.</li>
            <li>To also upregulate glutathione reductase to recycle oxidised glutathione to usable glutathione that can neutralise ROS and hence increasing the antioxidant capacity of the cell.</li>
