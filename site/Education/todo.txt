Things to do:
- Ensure that Talk.html has proper content in it
- Images in Escape_Room.html are scaled better and positioned correctly
- Make sure references fit the grid properly
- Interview may need the video/audio files? As well as links to social media. Maybe include minimalistic icons.
- Image Scaling in High_School.html

- add in stuff after Kings School interview, idk where tho lol

Optional:
- Include minimalistic icons to represent certain areas of each page, eg social media = social media icons
- Add block background behind each title as a full width divider between the sections
- Maybe change book to have a slideshow bc pdf embed looks ugly
- find alternative to pdf embed cough
