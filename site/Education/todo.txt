Things to do:
- Interview may need the video/audio files? As well as links to social media. Maybe include minimalistic icons.
- Remember to adjust grammar corrections
- Ensure image sizes are cool
- Make links to recordings and files similar to 2019 unsw igem

Optional:
- Include minimalistic icons to represent certain areas of each page, eg social media = social media icons
- Add block background behind each title as a full width divider between the sections
- Maybe change book to have a slideshow bc pdf embed looks ugly
- find alternative to pdf embed cough
