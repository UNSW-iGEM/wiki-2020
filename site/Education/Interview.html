    <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
    <p>As part of this interview we prepared brief presentation slides to explain our project. We chose to use presentation slides as we found it to be a more effective way of communicating our project. This is particularly true for visual learners where visual presentation would increase their understanding of the materials. (1) However, the target audience of our presentation were individuals with scientific knowledge, excessive explanation was not required.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, an interview format was chosen to communicate with Josemary as it was a more direct method of communicating and discussing our ideas where answers can be readily provided in the discussion. This leads to an effortless and productive dialogue between us and MolecularCloud. In addition to this, the <b><a href="https://youtu.be/gBtkg9wrKJc">recording of the interview</a></b> allows us to present the content to a significantly greater audience with the aim of communicating our project to other scientific communities to develop other innovative solutions to save corals.
