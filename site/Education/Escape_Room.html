    <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
    </div>
    <p>This project was initially chosen to increase the amount of people we could expose our project to as well as exposure to the issue of Coral Bleaching that is occurring on our coast as of now. Online Escape Rooms have shown tremendous success in terms of reach out to university students, especially here at UNSW. Furthermore, due to the conditions of social distancing and need for social interactions with friends, we have seen more success with these kinds of escape rooms especially now. This event was made in mind for a ‘collaborative interaction’ inducing a more engaging experience amongst teammates. (1) Escape Rooms have a lot of potential for creativity as we can create and adapt the story and visuals to whatever format we choose. This idea and execution came from a member of the UNSW Puzzle Society with expertise in creating these kinds of events who had seen recent immense success with another faculty reaching over 250 university students, leading to being one of the biggest online events of the year. We hoped to achieve a similar success in reach as well to experience the journey that the UNSW iGEM team had gone on throughout the year.</p>

    <h1>INTENTIONS</h1>
    <p>As aforementioned, we planned on targeting university students. These materials are to be used in a very recreational way with small facts about the issue we are targeting as well as parallels to the solution we have intended. The story that was made along with the puzzles is understandable by students of all disciplines with low reliance of scientific knowledge. This is enforced by welcoming visuals that were carefully made to provide an immersive experience for those who want to do the escape room. Those with interest in this kind of content are able to understand the basic science of our solution with relation to preventing coral bleaching as well as stay immersed in the puzzles and stories!</p>

    <p><b>need to make these side by side xoxo</b></p>
    <p>To ensure we reach a larger audience, we collaborated with a faculty society to reach out to further audiences. Moreover, we created a competitive event with a cash prize to encourage further participation. The event was heavily promoted by the UNSW Puzzle Society and BABSOC. The UNSW Puzzle Society members would be people outside of the Synthetic Biology scope who were interested in participating. BABSOC brought members who either had a basic or strong knowledge of synthetic biology and the works of our project. We even showed it off with some sneak peek visuals at our previous symposium event with the international teams. Hence, we reached a large and diverse audience of over 50 people participating in the event and many more who chose to try it out afterwards as it is still available online through this <a id="Medal" href="https://bit.ly/unswigemcc">link</a>! In addition, we have a potential collaboration with the  Student Science Squad and University of Melbourne iGEM team to create a synthetic biology themed event in which we will incorporate this game with it.</p>

    <h1>EVALUATION FOR THE FUTURE</h1>
    <p>If this was to be done again, I can recommend doing a recreational activity like this. Welcoming aesthetics and heavy promotion to relevant demographics provide a strong opportunity for people to be encouraged to join and be exposed to the iGEM project. Content and activities should be creative and engaging for the target demographic to ensure that dialogue is initiated.</p>
