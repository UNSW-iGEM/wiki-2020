    <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
    <p>This book titled “Captain Coral to the Rescue!” is targeted for children from the ages of 6 to 9. This activity book introduces children to:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Main causes of global warming and; </li>
        <li>The effect it has on coral bleaching.</li>
    </ol> 

    <p>The book’s storyline revolves around a young clownfish named Little JJ who learns about the reason behind why the ice cream was melting and corals were decolouring and is then taught by Captain Coral on how it can be stopped. Essentially, the storyline and activities show children how they can contribute to the prevention of coral bleaching; which is to do their part in decreasing global warming. We targeted children as introducing scientific concepts at a young age helps to increase better understanding of the issue as they grow up. (1) Although children cannot contribute directly in scientific research, we wanted to expose them to coral bleaching and empower them to do their part regardless of age.

    <h1>INTENTIONS</h1>
    <p>We chose to create a picture book as visual aids have shown to improve understanding in children. (2) Moreover we also included hands-on activities to empower children to do their part in saving the corals2. The activities include a 5-day save the Earth and Corals challenge, design your own coral reef, Furthermore, we included fun facts to spark further curiosity.</p>  

    <p>This is a versatile book that can be used in many different contexts involving the targeted age group. It can be incorporated in lesson plans by educators in primary schools or it can simply be used by parents/guardians in a domestic setting while spending some quality time with the children. It can also potentially be used to educate young visitors in a public aquarium and as a tool to raise funds for the cause of saving the corals. The team was able to successfully distribute the book to several primary school educators, tutors and parents/guardians and other family members. We have gotten positive feedback from children who have shown clear understanding of the two issues we introduced in the book. We have also contacted Student Science Squad and University of Melbourne iGEM team to potentially distribute our book to many more primary schools.</p>  

    <p>Children who read the book will be able to share the information they have learnt with other children through lesson plans educators create or just via daily conversations. Furthermore, this book allows for open discussion among not only children but also between the educators and parents/ guardians and the children who are involved. The activities in the book are designed such that children would require assistance to encourage more opportunities for discussions about the issues.</p>
