    <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
    <p>This book titled “Captain Coral to the Rescue!” is targeted for children from the ages of 6 to 9. </p>
    <div class= 'book'>
        <ol>
            <p>This activity book introduces children to:</p>
            <li>Main causes of global warming and; </li>
            <li>The effect it has on coral bleaching.</li>
        </ol> 
    </div>
    <p>The book’s storyline revolves around a young clownfish named Little JJ who learned about the reason behind why 
        the ice cream was melting and corals were decolouring and was then taught by Captain Coral on how it can be 
        stopped. Essentially, the storyline and activities show children how they can contribute to the prevention of 
        coral bleaching; which is to do their part in decreasing global warming. We targeted children as introducing 
        scientific concepts at a young age helps to increase better understanding of the issue as they grow up. (1) 
        Although children cannot contribute directly in scientific research, we wanted to expose them to coral bleaching 
        and empower them to do their part regardless of age.</p>    

    <h1>INTENTIONS</h1>
    <p>
        We chose to create a picture book as visual aids have shown to improve understanding in children. (2) Moreover 
        we also included hands-on activities to empower children to do their part in saving the corals. (2) The activities 
        include a 5-day save the Earth and Corals challenge, design your own coral reef. Furthermore, we included fun 
        facts to spark further curiosity.

        This is a versatile book that can be used in many different contexts involving the targeted age group. It can be 
        incorporated in lesson plans by educators in primary schools or it can simply be used by parents/guardians in a 
        domestic setting while spending some quality reading time with the children. It can also potentially be used to 
        educate young visitors in a public aquarium and as a tool to raise funds for the cause of saving the corals. The 
        team was able to successfully distribute the book to several primary school educators, tutors and parents/guardians 
        and other family members. We have gotten positive feedback from children who have shown clear understanding of the 
        two issues we introduced in the book. Here are a few examples of the response that we have gotten from children who 
        have read the book then answered a worksheet prepared by their teacher as shown below. Furthermore, we have also 
        contacted the Student Science Squad and University of Melbourne’s iGEM team to potentially distribute our book to 
        many more primary schools. We are also currently in discussion with the Kings Junior School for a future 
        collaboration that will involve distribution of the children’s book.

        Children who read the book will be able to share the information they have learnt with other children through lesson 
        plans educators create or just via daily conversations. Furthermore, this book allows for open discussion among not 
        only children but also between the educators and parents/guardians and the children who are involved. The activities 
        in the book are designed such that children would require assistance from adults to encourage more opportunities for 
        discussions about the issues.
