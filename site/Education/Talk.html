        <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
        <p>Based on our own personal interactions with people outside of scientific circles we noticed there was a lack of awareness and understanding regarding the application of science. This lack of understanding regarding the applications of synthetic biology also manifested in the feedback forms of our education package (must attach link to edu package page). Due to this, we wanted to change the perspective of science to not just being a theoretical discipline but one that can be applied to the real world and the UNSW iGEM team also wanted to show that we are scientists who have observed that there was an issue and created a solution, within the laboratory and outside the laboratory. The need for this was further highlighted by the engagement from the audience that we generated during the discussion.</p>

        <h1>INTENTIONS</h1>
        <p>To facilitate this change in perspective, our team decided to present this applied aspect of science to the public. We presented an overview of our project including the problem and how we came up with a solution as an example to demonstrate how science can solve local and global problems. During the presentation, we used simpler language with bright and salient visuals to increase understandability from the general public.</p>
        <p>In addition, science communication was also discussed. Initially, this was performed by attendees through an interactive platform, followed by our team informing what science communication is  with some  examples of it during  the presentation.</p>

        <p>We were also aiming that with our presentation and panel discussion, it will bring about new ways of thinking to the attendees. Hence, we also had puzzles, rebuses in this case, delivered in the intermission symbolising new perspectives of thinking and to encourage audience engagement. This open discussion was continued with a panel discussion that was initiated with a question that we have prepared to give the public audience time to type in any questions that they had. Then, we managed to answer those questions regarding solving problems with science and other questions related to iGEM and our project.</p>
