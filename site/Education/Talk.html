        <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
        <p>We realised that many people know about scientific research but are unaware of the application of science. Due to this we wanted to change the perspective of science to not just being a theoretical discipline but one that can be applied to the real world. </p>

        <h1>INTENTIONS</h1>
        <p>To facilitate this change in perspective, our team decided to present this applied aspect of science to the public. We presented an overview of our project including the problem and how we came up with a solution as an example to demonstrate how science can solve local and global problems. During the presentation, we used simpler language with bright and salient visuals to increase understandability from the general public.
            </p>
        <p>In addition, we also introduce science communication to the public. This was performed initially by attendees through an interactive platform, followed by informing what science communication is  with some  examples of it during  the presentation. </p>

        <p>We were also aiming that with our presentation and panel discussion, it will bring about new ways of thinking to the attendees. Hence, we also had puzzles, rebuses in this case, delivered in the intermission symbolising new perspectives of thinking and to encourage audience engagement. This open discussion was continued with a panel discussion that was initiated with a question that we have prepared to give the public audience time to type in any questions that they had. Then, we managed to answer those questions regarding solving problems with science and other questions related to iGEM and our project. </p>
        <p>Our panel discussion had pre-set questions to enable the audience to further ask about the intricacies that came with being undergraduate students whilst working in science, especially science communication, and solving these kinds of challenges.
