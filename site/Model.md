To develop an understanding of the engineered Symbiodinium’s heat shock and ROS response, dry lab modelling was done to supplement the enzyme and oligomerisation assays from the wet lab. In the absence of informative literature about heat shock proteins and response in algae, we conducted our own original research. On the atomic level, to understand the mechanisms behind the HSP enzyme complex’s holdase function we constructed protein structure models. On the macroscopic level, to understand how the new heat shock and ROS response, we constructed a mathematical model to predict how substrates in the system change. This culminated in a more comprehensive understanding of how our engineered symbiodinium could potentially be heat resistant in the Great Barrier Reef.
