    <p>There are some challenges when determining how to implement our solution into the real world. A major limitation, for example, is the unlikelihood of releasing a genetically modified organism into an environment that is highly protected. By looking at the existing implementation methods others have used around the world, we can establish the ‘safest’ delivery of our project into the real world. Through the consultation of several experts who have experience in the area of coral regeneration, we were able to ideate a realistic implementation of our solution. </p>

      <h1>EX-SITU VS IN-SITU FARMING OF CORALS</h1>
    </div>
      <p>Revive and Restore, an NGO (and one of our major sponsors), led us to consider the different conservation ethics of developing our solution in either an ex-situ environment (i.e. outside the coral’s original environment and in tanks in the lab) or an in-situ environment (i.e. inside the coral’s original environment). To understand the pros and cons of each approach, our team consulted a number of marine experts who have had experience on coral restoration projects. </p>
      <p>Before the implementation of our solution, we believe it would be best to test our GM-symbiodinium ex-situ in tanks. Melissa Katon, an honours student from UNSW, gave us suggestions on how to build and test our engineered Symbiodinium before releasing them into the reef. She shared with us the possibility of ex-situ farming of corals in tanks which are facilitated by the Sydney Institute of Marine Science (SIMS); a possibility for our future lab work in Phase Two of our project. </p>
      <p>Correspondence with Lawrence Menz from the Maldive Coral Institute and Maldives Underwater Initiative (MUI), allowed us to determine how our solution could be tested in-situ after initial ex-situ testing. Lawrence suggested releasing our GM-symbiodinium into a location of the reef that contained little diversity would be the safest approach. Moreover, Lawrence stressed the importance of protecting the biodiversity of the reef by sharing his experience on past coral projects:</p>
      <p id="quote">“[The] MUI did a coral restoration project starting in 2016 and after the growth and out-planting phase, found that only one or two species survived... the project would end up reducing the biodiversity of our reef.”</p>
      <p>Therefore, when navigating potential in-situ testing, we must choose a location containing little diversity, or a location that is considered dead, in order to protect the biodiversity of the reef still considered healthy. Ultimately, our team has to be vigilant about the preservation of the original biodiversity of the reef, otherwise, our project will completely be out of the picture for real-world implementation.</p>
      <p>Licensing to implement our solution in-situ was further explored with the help of David Suggett. He shared his experience of permit justification for reef restoration in the GBR. David advised us if we were to have our solution become a reality, we would need to convince powerful bodies, such as the Marine Parks Authority, that implementation of our solution would be done responsibly with thorough risk assessment. Working with industry partners who are also desperate to see solutions put into place would further express the need for a solution. David Suggett suggested our solution be “likened to an insurance company”, that is, providing a solution that will ensure the livelihood of the reef in conjunction with our engineered Symbiodinium. </p>

    <div class="weeks">
      <h1>IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR SOLUTION</h1>
    </div>
      <p>Our proposed end-users involve two major groups: the organisms who inhabit coral reefs; and the humans whose livelihoods depend on the GBR, such as those involved in bioprospecting and tourism & fishing practices. Implementation of our solution seeks to protect both groups of end-users, with an aim to promote the thriving of both ecosystem and industry alike. If successful, we envision our solution will be one that spans across generations and provides vast intergenerational benefits.</p>
      <p>The possibility of implementing our project as a ‘coral conservation product’ will allow our solution to be modular for use in various coral environments. Companies such as non-government organisations (NGOs), or even the identification of a commercial aquarium trade, will give us the opportunity to spread our solution in a commercialised manner. The ongoing communication between marine organisations and the members of our team will allow PROTECC Coral to be applied in a safe and responsible manner.</p>
      <p>Moreover, one of the goals of our project is to share our results with the wider science community. By being transparent with the science community and making our solution open-source, we will help contribute to a global effort to save coral reefs. In the least, we envision that implementation of parts of our solution may contribute to a world-wide effort undertaken by the science community.</p>

      <h1>LICENSING AND PERMIT APPLICATIONS</h1>
    </div>
      <p>To test our engineered Symbiodinium in-situ, several applications would have to be undertaken in order to gain permits for on-site testing:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority requires <b><a href="http://elibrary.gbrmpa.gov.au/jspui/bitstream/11017/3647/1/Checklist-of-application-information-research.pdf">research applicants</a></b> to justify the reasons as to why certain locations of the reef were chosen, as well as our proposed route of research. As explained by Lawrence Menz, the best and safest way to implement our engineered Symbiodinium into the ocean is to release them to a part of the reef that has already lost its biodiversity. </li>
        <li>It is also important to keep up with the <b><a href="http://www.ogtr.gov.au/internet/ogtr/publishing.nsf/content/9AA09BB4515EBAA2CA257D6B00155C53/$File/11%20-%20Genetically%20modified%20(GM)%20crops%20in%20Australia.pdf">OGTR standards </a></b> of risk analysis and regulation of our solution: “Genetically modified (GM)… crops grown in Australia were approved for commercial release only when the regulator found that the GM crops were safe for human health and the environment as non-GM versions”.</li>
      </ol>

      <h1>OTHER CHALLENGES TO BE CONSIDRED IN THE FUTURE</h1>
    </div>
    <ol>
      <li><b>COVID-19 Limitations:</b> The most prominent challenge faced during a global pandemic is the limitations brought upon the scope of our lab work. Therefore, the continuation of lab work in Phase Two of our project will be more extensive, assuming COVID-19 limitations are lifted. Despite these challenges, the relationships we have established and the advice gathered in Phase One of our project will be useful for our future team’s workflow and approach to their lab work.</li>
      <li><b>Selection of the Correct Coral Species:</b> From the advice gathered in Phase One of our project, our future team will have to consider what species of coral they would like to work with. From the advice gathered this year, it is best to work species of coral which are unprotected, or common coral species which are used in most coral research work. General lab details, such as updates to the safety form, must also be considered when working with coral species, as lab work will be more complex and new ethical concerns will have to be considered.</li>
