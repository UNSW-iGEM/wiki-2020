title: Science Communication Overview
---

	<section class="introduction">
		<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
		<p>Science communication is an essential part of science. It allows the sharing of research results, conclusions, and the rationale behind the research among a plethora of stakeholders such  as other scientists and the members of the society. Therefore, we made an attempt,despite the pandemic, to share information about synthetic biology and our project to a wide range of audiences from primary school students to the general public. </p>

		<p>The materials created by the team for the purposes of science communication was based on research, suggestions, and support from the previous UNSW iGEM team members, UNSW Puzzle Society, and the BABSOC (School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences Student Society). We aimed to gather constructive feedback and spark open discussions about synthetic biology and coral bleaching among target audiences through various modes of communication including written texts, videos, games, and presentations. (1) This led to the creation of the different components of science communication such as a children’s book, an education package, a virtual escape room game, a recorded interview video with MolecularCloud, and a presentation for the general public. From these, the team hopes that we have and will continue to increase awareness and inspire the society to contribute to the prevention of coral bleaching. Therefore, we also have some potential future collaborations that we have planned with other partners. </p>

		<div class="category-des">
			<p>The children’s book is targeted for children of the ages from 6 to 9. This book aims to introduce children to: 1) main causes of global warming and 2) the effect it has on coral bleaching. It is both a story book and an activity book which empowers students to suppress global warming and hence coral bleaching. </p>

			<p>Science communication between those within the scientific community is essential for advancing scientific research and allows for others to build up from the work of others. Due to this, means of scientific communication in the sharing of thoughts, resources, research and more is essential and can be facilitated through forums such as MolecularCloud. MolecularCloud is an open-access, not-for-profit science communication platform sponsored by GenScript. As a communication platform they are at the forefront of improving scientific communication. On 1 October 2020, our team took part in an interview with Josemary  Medrano from MolecularCloud which was later uploaded to the MolecularCloud Instagram and YouTube channel where it obtained over 300 views in total.</p>
