title: Science Communication Overview
---

	<section class="introduction">
		<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
		<p>
			Science communication is an essential part of science. It allows the sharing of research results, conclusions, and the rationale behind the research among a plethora of stakeholders such  as other scientists and the members of the society. Therefore, we made an attempt, despite the pandemic, to share information about synthetic biology and our project to a wide range of audiences from primary school students to the general public. 
		</p>
		<p>The materials created by the team for the purposes of science communication was based on research, suggestions, and support from the previous UNSW iGEM team members, UNSW Puzzle Society, and UNSW BABSOC (School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences Student Society). We aimed to gather constructive feedback and spark open discussions about synthetic biology and coral bleaching among target audiences through various modes of communication including written texts, videos, games, and presentations. (1) This led to the creation of the different components of science communication such as a children’s book, an education package, a virtual escape room game, a recorded interview video with MolecularCloud, and a presentation for the general public. From these, the team hopes that we have and will continue to increase awareness and inspire our community  to contribute to the prevention of coral bleaching. Therefore, we also have some potential future collaborations that we have planned with other partners. </p></section>

			<p>
				The children’s book was targeted for children of the ages from six to nine. This book aimed to introduce children to 1) The main causes of global warming and 2) The effect it has on coral bleaching. It is both a story book and an activity book which empowers students to suppress global warming and hence coral bleaching.

		<div class="category-des">
			<p>
				An interview session about our project overview was conducted between the MolecularCloud and the UNSW 2020 iGEM team. The aim of this interview was to communicate our project on solutions to save coral to the communities.

		<div class="category-des">
			<p>
				“How is Science Solving Local and Global Challenges?” was the theme to our presentation and panel discussion about taking on challenges. This was based on our iGEM project where a multidisciplinary team of undergraduate students work within and out of the laboratory to help solve this issue to tackle coral bleaching.</p><a href="/Education/Talk"><button>READ MORE</button></a>
