	<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
	<p>The UNSW iGEM team believes collaboration is an essential part of science. Collaboration between scientists includes the sharing of knowledge and resources in various creative ways, and helps to implement more significant work in society. Over the past year, we have sought to form and maintain meaningful relationships with other iGEM teams and members. Through mentorship and friendly camaraderie, our team has truly enjoyed and gained insight into the collaborative nature of the scientific discipline. </p>

	<p>2020 has not been the most ideal year for engaging in the typical in-person collaboration activities with other iGEM teams. Although our team did not get to enjoy the same privilege as previous teams, we were able to explore new and unique ways to collaborate with other teams both nationally and internationally. Building relationships with other iGEM teams has given us a taste of what it feels like to be one part of a global effort to prevent coral bleaching, as well as efforts to preserve the greater marine environment. </p>

<section class="symposium">
	<h1>CORAL SYMPOSIUM</h1>
	<p>The UNSW iGEM team was excited to engage with teams on the international stage for the ‘UNSW iGEM Virtual Coral Symposium 2020’, held on the 24th of September. As with most events and initiatives in 2020, multiple teams navigated Zoom to present the development progress of their coral bleaching prevention projects, and engage in constructive and meaningful discussion about practicing science during the COVID-19 era. The international audience combined university students, the general public and coral and marine experts, and facilitated a rich, interesting and multi-layered discussion about our proposed synthetic biological solutions.</p>

	<p>We were so glad to be joined by the Exeter team from England and the St. Andrews team from Scotland. Through mentoring meetings peppered throughout the year, we had a preconceived idea of what each team’s project involved. However, the symposium provided a valuable opportunity to see each team’s project presented as a whole, as well as learn from their presentation and communication techniques. </p>

		<h2>Exeter Team</h2>
		<p>The Exeter team presented their project “CalcifEXE”, which aims to produce a new carbon negative 3D bioprinter to enable the printing of calcium carbonate into custom shapes that can act as backbones to coral reefs. This would allow coral regeneration to be sped up in damaged reefs.</p>

		<h2>St. Andrews Team</h2>
		<p>The St. Andrews team presented their project “Shinescreen”, which aims to produce a sustainable and coral friendly sunscreen, providing protection to corals from  the toxic chemicals normally found in traditional sunscreens. </p>
	</div>

	<p>Each team was given a designated amount of time to present their project, focusing on their progress throughout the year, and the ‘journey’ their project has taken in response to research, lab work, and outreach to stakeholders. It was fascinating to see how each team demonstrated a highly considered and integrated response to the coral bleaching problem. Finally, each team was allocated time to take questions from any participant of the symposium. iGEM team members, experts, and audience enjoyed asking thought-provoking questions, which teams no doubt will consider in the remaining weeks of the project. Much discussion was also had in respect to the difficulties posed by COVID-19, particularly in regards to lab access and stakeholder outreach. It was interesting and uplifting to engage with each teams’ responses to these challenges.</p>

	<p>Each team was also asked to invite one to two ‘experts’ who have mentored and informed their work over the year. Following each team’s presentation, experts were invited to give a short presentation of their area of research, and their contributions to their iGEM team. This allowed for a rich forum of international perspective on different research aimed to combat coral bleaching. We’d like to extend a heartfelt thanks to our experts for giving us their time and insight:</p>

		<p>The role of molecular chaperones in cells to promote both the correct folding of new proteins, as well as the aggregation of proteins particularly under denaturing conditions. Thermal stress can cause proteins to denature and unfold, thus losing their structure. Cells have thus developed very complex mechanisms to prevent protein folding and aggregating, as they are very energetically expensive processes</p>

<section class="communications">
	<h1>COMMUNICATIONS</h1>
	<p>Communication with different iGEM across various time zones has been a challenge for us all. This year, we have been reaching out to other iGEM teams mainly through emails that we found from the igem registry. The great initiative taken by the iGEM HQ to establish our first iGEMers slack channel has also helped us to make contact with Hainan China. We later took on this idea, and created a slack channel between Exeter, St. Andrews and Hainan where we found it much easier to communicate compared to email which usually takes weeks to get a reply. The last and the most important form of communication is through zoom calls, where we get to link the names with the faces and have meaningful conversation with each other. </p>

	<h1>OUR TEAM COLLABORATIONS</h1>
	
	<div class="exeter">
		<img id="height" src="/assets/images/collaborations/exeter igem logo.jpg">
		<h2>Exeter</h2>
		<p>The Exeter iGEM team is working on a similar theme to the UNSW iGEM team in effort to preserve the marine environment. They are developing a carbon negative 3D bioprinter that prints various shapes of calcium carbonate acting as the coral reef backbones. By this project, it is hoped that a faster regeneration of corals in damaged reefs could occur. </p>
		<p>We have managed to collaborate with them via Zoom as suggested after some previous contacts through emails. The collaboration  includes the exchange of ideas and some discussion on the issues that the UNSW iGEM team might have in applying GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) into the environment. Other legal and policy discussion was also carried out as the Exeter iGEM team would like to patent their work in developing the coral backbones. Some human practices contacts were also shared during  the meeting. In a further collaboration, the Exeter iGEM team was also invited to the coral themed symposium hosted by the UNSW iGEM team. With this symposium, the Exeter iGEM team also helped in promoting the event in their social media which helped us in reaching out to a wider audience around the world. </p>

		<img src="/assets/images/collaborations/St. Andrews igem logo.png">
		<h2>St. Andrews</h2>
		<p>In relation with our team’s project on preventing coral bleaching due to the increase in temperature, coral bleaching could also be as a result of the toxic chemicals found in sunscreens. The St. Andrews iGEM team is working on sustainable and coral friendly sunscreen which aligns with our main aim to protect corals. </p>
		<p>Collaboration with the St. Andrews iGEM team was performed by exchanging some experts' contacts to help to improve both teams’ projects with more experts’ opinions. Discussions on each teams’ projects were also carried via several Zoom calls. In these discussions, we exchange several research articles on coral microorganisms and coral heat studies. The UNSW iGEM team also helped the St. Andrews iGEM team to complete and provide suggestions on their online survey on public attitudes on sunscreens and coral bleaching in different countries. In order to receive Australian perspectives for the survey, we also shared them through our facebook page. In addition, the. UNSW iGEM team also invited the St. Andrews iGEM team to be one of the featured presenting teams in the ‘UNSW iGEM Virtual Coral Symposium 2020’. For the symposium, the St. Andrews iGEM team also helped in promoting the event through their social media to reach out to a wider audience not only in Australia, but also around the world.</p>

		<img id="height" src="/assets/images/collaborations/hainan china logo.png">
		<h2>Hainan China</h2>
		<p>In contrast to our focus on elevating the heat tolerance of Symbiodinium, the Hainan China iGEM team has turned their focus to microbial symbionts of the coral. By introducing ‘probiotics' to the system it may be able to nourish the coral symbiotic relationship. Therefore enhancing the survivability of the coral under extreme environmental conditions.</p>
		<p>We have organised two zoom calls with Hainan China during the early stage of both our projects, in which we introduced the core idea behind our project and also gained valuable insights from their approaches to the problem. After the meeting, we exchanged some primary and secondary research papers on the topic of coral bleaching and various coral symbionts. Beyond the scope of science, we also collaborated on the level of HP by filling out their survey and making few suggestions to their survey.</p>

		<h2>DeNovocastrians</h2>
		<p>As a newly joining team to the iGEM competition in this unusual year, kits supplies have been an issue for the DeNovocastrians iGEM team from the University of Newcastle in Australia. To carry out their project on using bacterial systems to degrade benzene in the environment, the UNSW iGEM team has helped them by sending Biobrick Part pSB1C3. This particular part was from the UNSW iGEM 2018 team and therefore, we were able to provide them with the suggestion on how they would be able to use the specific part.</p>

	<div class="st-andrews">
		<img id="height" src="/assets/images/collaborations/uppsala igem logo.png">
		<h2>Uppsala</h2>
		<p>Due to the global pandemic, the iGEM team at Uppsala initiated an initiative which reached out to teams over the globe to understand the struggles of teams in various countries. Our team shared our experiences of the challenges we had to face due to the global pandemic and how this affected our work in the lab and how we communicated with each other. We would like to thank the Uppsala team for reaching out to us in a means to stay connected during a time we have to be physically distant. </p>
