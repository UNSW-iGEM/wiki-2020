# Description

WikiMate is a tool for verifying whether your iGEM wiki has all of the required pages for your track and any special awards you are going for. Simply enter your team name and WikiMate will tell you if you have content on at mandatory URL. Donâ€™t miss out on that gold medal because you forgot to add some bronze criteria or misspelt a url.

WikiMate is written in javascript and runs in the browser.
