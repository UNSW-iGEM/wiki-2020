		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>
			Australia’s global identity is hallmarked by the Great Barrier Reef, a biologically diverse and valuable ecosystem. Its coral reef, the largest in the world, contains over 600 coral species, accounting for three-quarters of the world’s population. Currently, it is experiencing its third coral bleaching event in just five years. February 2020 saw the highest monthly temperature recorded on the Great Barrier Reef. The coral bleaching that has occurred in 2020 is more widespread and severe than it has ever been.

			Reef building coral is composed of ‘polyps’ which secrete white calcium carbonate skeletons (CaCO3). In Australia, these coral polyps contain symbiotic microalgae including the family Symbiodiniaceae, which generate nutrients necessary for survival <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25202301/">(Roth M.S, 2014)</a>. External stressors, like the increase of ocean temperatures, cause protein denaturation and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within algal cells. The cessation of nutrient provision by algal symbionts, due to the rejection of Symbiodiniaceae, results in coral starvation and death. As microalgae leave the coral polyp, the remaining white skeleton is visible as bleached reefs.

		<p>With our team of 16, the journey of creating a solution to the strenuous issue of coral bleaching has been a challenging yet positive experience.<br>

		The wide variety of members in our team from different backgrounds such as law, software engineering and molecular biology has lead to the development of our team’s multidisciplinary approach to an Australian conservation problem that considers the nexus of science and society.<br>

		Our team members are dedicated to conferring practical and intergenerational benefits for the Great Barrier Reef using the emerging capabilities of synthetic biology in the effort to improve global coral environments.</p>
